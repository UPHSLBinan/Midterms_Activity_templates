                        <h2>1. White Beach, Boracay</h2>
                        <h3>Location: White Beach Boracay, Aklan, Philippines</h3><br>
                        <p>White Beach is located on the island of Borocay, about 315 km to the south of Manila. This beach is situated off the Panay Island's north-western tip and represents the aesthetically rich natural scenery of Borocay and the Philippines. There are tropical surroundings, panoramic ocean view, and various forms of vegetation and wildlife.<br><br>
                           White Beach is about 3 km long, and has been divided into three sections, each having its characteristic charm and uniqueness. While Station 1 presents a quiet, low key atmosphere where most of the luxurious resorts and hotels are present, Station 2 is livelier thanks to its expansive shopping, entertainment and dining zones. The quietest part is Station 3, which has several native houses and bungalows.

                        <h2>2. White Island, Camiguin</h2>
                        <h3>Location: White Island, Medano Islet, Philippines</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            White Island is an uninhabited sandbar, so there isn't any trees or man-made structures that could offer protection from the sun. If you're going, make sure to bring enough water and sunblock. It's good for snorkelling, but be wary of sea urchins and sea snakes. <br><br>
                            The sandbar is really stunning though - its shape and size changes according to the tide and the season. You'll enjoy the fine sand and clean waters, while the view of Hibok-Hibok Volcano makes for postcard-worthy snapshots. The best time to go to White Island is during summer as boats usually won't venture out when the weather is bad.

                        <h2>3. Matukad Island, Caramoan</h2>
                        <h3>Location: Caramoan, Camarines Sur, Philippines</h3><br>
                        <p>Matukad is a small island off the coast of Caramoan. It has fine, white sand beaches flanked by towering limestone cliffs. Its most intriguing feature is the presence of a lagoon, which is home to a solitary giant milkfish. There's an interesting story about this, so you can ask the boatman for the details. You might be able to spot the milkfish during your visit, so make sure to bring your camera and do a bit of trekking to get to the lagoon. The view from above is astounding.

                        <h2>4. Daku, Naked and Guyam, Siargao</h2>
                        <h3>Location: South-eastern coast of Siargao Island, Philippines</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            Daku, Naked and Guyam are a group of islets in Siargao that are accessible by joining an island-hopping tour. A day trip to these destinations typically starts at Naked Island, named due to the absence of vegetation or coconut trees. The heat can be rather scorching, so bring sunblock along with you. The islet's white sand is popular for sunbathing before continuing to the next stop.<br><br>
                            Guyam Island is an interesting mix of sandy beach on one end and hard corals on the other. The final stop is the Daku Island, where you can have your lunch of fresh seafood and coconut juice in either a rented hut or beneath the palm trees. Its serene and crystal-clear water and fine, white sand makes it ideal for swimming.

                        <h2>5. Kalanggaman Island, Leyte</h2>
                        <h3>Location: Palompon, Leyte, Philippines</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            Kalanggaman Island in Leyte is one of the most beautiful islands in the Philippines. Its major draw is its long sandbar that stretches from one end of the island. It is quite spectacular when the tide ebbs to reveal it. Signs urge you to be careful if you're not a good swimmer, as the sandbank moves together with the changing tides.<br><br>
                            Camping is allowed on the island - on clear nights, you can see the night sky dotted with millions of stars. Boat rental going to Kalanggaman Island costs 3,000 pesos on average. If you're sharing the boat with another group, make sure to agree on your return time since the boat only makes 1 trip back to the mainland.
