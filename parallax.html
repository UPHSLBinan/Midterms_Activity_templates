            <h2> Konohagakure</h2>
            <p>Konohagakure (木ノ葉隠れの里, Konohagakure no Sato; literally meaning "Village Hidden by Tree Leaves"), also known as "Village Hidden in the Leaves" or "Hidden Leaf Village" is the hidden village of the Land of Fire. As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Konohagakure has a Kage as its leader, known as the Hokage. On a mountain overlooking the village from the north exists the Hokage Monument which has the faces of all those who have taken the office of Hokage engraved on it. The shinobi of this village wear blue or black shirts which may or may not have swirl patterns on the shoulders, along with matching coloured pants over a green flak jacket which also has a red swirl on the back, and pockets on the chest area.
                <br> <br>Before the ninja villages came into being, there was the Era of the Warring Clans when ninja were organised into small mercenary clans that knew nothing but battle. Two such clans were the Senju clan and the Uchiha clan, who have warred against each other since the time of their ancestors and are revered by others as the strongest ninja clans. Eventually, intending to end the countless bloodshed, Hashirama Senju used his power as leader of his clan to enter a truce with the Uchiha clan despite reluctance from its leader Madara Uchiha. Afterwards, the two clans would form the first shinobi village where Madara and Hashirama had met as children: Konohagakure — a name invented by Madara himself. Hashirama Senju used his Wood Release abilities to produce much of the villages' infrastructure. This ability and his ideals were two of the reasons he was chosen to become the village's leader, the Hokage.
